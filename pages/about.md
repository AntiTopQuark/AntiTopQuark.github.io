> Hello Stranger, Welcome to AntiTopQuark Blog

Allow me to pay tribute to the author--[TMaize Blog](https://github.com/TMaize/tmaize-blog) of the theme of my blog.

I`m a developer of OceanBase. I think OceanBase is the most amazing database in the world.

I hope i can write some articals on the blog that will be in english.

The article will be some experience in the development process. For example, the analysis of some programming language features, the analysis of the database.

Hope they can bring you some help.

I'm not going to post simple bug fixes, these can be found on Google.

Hope you all have fun!
